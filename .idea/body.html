			<h1> Products!</h1>
		</div>
		<p> Okie! Easiest and fastest page, so let's run it! Products can be broken down, we got body wash for one, which wipes off dirt and freshens your skin,
			body SCRUBS that cause your skin to shine a little brighter and feel smoother, and body cleansers, they clean your inner skin in case you got acne.</p>

			<h2> How to Wash! </h2>
		</div>
		<p> Alrighty! Lets-do-it! Easiest part out of these three pages.  </p>
		<ol>
			<li> 1. Step into the shower and let the warm water strip any dirt off for a minute. </li>
			<li> 2. Use either a silicone body scrubber or a loofa, I recommend the silicone scrubber. </li>
			<li> 3. Pour the body wash of your favorite scent onto the item you're using. </li>
			<li> 4. Then let the water hit the body wash before scrubbing your body, make sure to HIT EVERY SPOT, even places like behind your ear, shoulders, and armpits. </li>
			<li> 5. Let the body wash rest on your skin for around a minute or so, until the foam starts to fade. </li>
			<li> 6. After use cold water to wash it off. </li>
		</ol>

		<h3> What not to do! </h3>
	</div>

	<p> It's pretty small to mess up or the chances to, but we'll cover those anyway!</p>
	<ol>
		<li> 1. Do NOT let the water hit you while you scrub: Gives the body wash no chance to sink into your skin. </li>
		<li> 2. Do NOT let swap water temperatures as your skin won't care if you're cold or not, it won't close nor open your skin. </li>
		<li> 3. Lastly, do NOT give light scrubs, that doesn't mean go super hard but don't be super gentle anyway.</li>
	</ol>

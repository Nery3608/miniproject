		<p> SO! This will probably be second shortest page because of how easy and simple it is. It's so simple in fact, I could literally
		say, use a cleanser and moisturizer.... That's it. It's that easy! But we'll break it down since there's different skin types.
		Okay! There's three different types of skin for people: certain people have oily skin which produces a lot of oils and grease.
		There's people with dry skin, which means their skin doesn't produce enough oils. Then you have balanced skin which has a mix of both.</p>

		<h3> When! </h3>
	</div>

	<p> Last part, when to cleanse? Well! Depending on your skin is how much you cleanse, if you have oily skin, it's ideal to cleanse twice a day.
		But if you have balanced or dry skin, once a day is just fine!</p>

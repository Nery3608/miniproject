			<h1> Understanding the Basics!</h1>
		</div>
		<p> Okie! Let's start with the first step, your hair! Now depending on your hair type, explains what you'll need,
		after all, long hair and short hair are going to need their own products. You're probably asking, well, what's my hair type if they are all different?? :p </p>

			<h2> Identifying Hair Types and Products</h2>
		</div>
		<p> Let's start with hair types first. Each person is different, so we'll cover straight hair first.
		If your hair is pin straight, its type 1. If your hair has a slight wave to it, you have 2a!
			If your hair has a noticeable wave, you have 2b. However, if its really obvious, you have 2c. Going into type 3, if you have large curls, you have 3a.
		If your hair has medium sized curls, you have 3b. But if you have smaller more loopy curls, you have 3c!
		Lastly, coils! If your hair is similar to loops and small coils, you have 4a. If your coils start to expand vertically, you have 4b!
			Although, if they start to look like zigzags and W's, you have 4c.</p>

		<p> With that covered, lets go into products! Now, since I have straight and slight wavy hair, I'll only be covering those products as I am not experienced in the other more curly and coily hair.
		With hair, its generally the same... </p>

		<ol>
			<li>  1. Step into the shower and set the water to a hot - warm temperature. Let your hair soak up the warm water so the hair follicles start opening up.</li>
			<li>  2. Pour a dime sized amount of shampoo, make sure to watch ingredients like sulfur or sodium nitrate(if you're sensitve to that.), onto your hand. </li>
			<li>  3. Rub the shampoo onto your palms and then gently rub it into your scalp, make sure to focus on the <strong>SCALP</strong> not the hair strands, thats later.</li>
			<li>  4. Wait around 3 minutes when you're finished rubbing into your scalp before rinsing it out.</li>
		</ol>
			<p> Badda boom! Already getting it! Lets finish it with some conditioner! Beware, this depends entirely on your length. Longer hair == More conditioner amount. </p>

		<ol>
			<li> 1. Pour the conditoner onto your palm, quarter sized for short to medium and so on. It's an experiment sort of deal so you'll have to be patient! </li>
			<li> 2. Rub the conditoner in between your fingers in order to maximize efficiency. </li>
			<li> 3. Then, start from the root of your hair and begin to press the conditoner into your hair. (Make sure to slide down to your hair tips as you go)</li>
			<li> 4. Once you hit every spot on your hair, wait around 3 to 4 minutes then rinse with.. <em> <strong> COLD </strong></em> water, not warm. I know, its cold.. But it'll make sure to seal up your hair strands. </li>
		</ol>

		<h3> Do's and Don'ts </h3>
	</div>
	<p> Wham! You're all done for your hair! You'll be smelling better and feeling better already! :) But let's cover some do's and don'ts, shall we?</p>
	<ol>
		<li> DON'T --- Don't switch the order, its shampoo THEN conditoner.</li>
		<li> DO --- Watch for ingredients, beware! </li>
		<li> KEEP IN MIND --- Just because a product works for someone, means it'll work for you, everyone is different! </li>
		<li> DO ---  Do research on products that targer your hair type! Not just what everyone says. </li>
	</ol>
